Project Description & Introduction: This project was iniated as part of a College assignment, however this is my first solo C program and I have created it to be very thorough, so I will add to this program if and where I see fit for upgrades and efficiencies down the line. The aim of this program is to replicate some standard functionalities of an ATM and is built with C programming knowledge of Arrays, a variety of loop types and Data structures. This program follows strict coding standards in terms of layout and indentation aswell as effective error handling and input validation mechanisms which are in-line with my current knowledge of C programming.

Log of Porgram updates:

9/01/2017 - First upload of project following an extensive development period of project planning, highlighting project requirements and then the code writing and hundreds of program re-writes. The file is finally in its BETA 1.0 version and In the next iterations of the C file I wish to add Dynamic Memory Allocation (DMA), not that it will vastly improve this program in terms of memory usage, but perhaps bring small memory management gains and - if nothing else to keep the program up-to-date with my learning experiences.
